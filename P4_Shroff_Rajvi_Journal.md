Period 4 

Friday, May 6th (in class) - 1 hour 30 mins

I assisted in making a new branch and helped in moving the ArcadeEngine files into the new file. As a group, we added our finished README and I was involved in the brainstorming process.  

Friday, May 13th (in class) - 1 hour 30 mins

I helped in fleshing out what each of our classes will look like. As a group, we worked on making our game together and adding to our Game class, GameWorld class, and Tile class. I was responsible for physically coding the ideas as we came up with ideas and committing to GitHub. The code now had tiles, and they had a num value and appeared with a corresponding image. There was also code for a scaled distance between the tiles. The code also contained pseudocode on key events for up movement, 
and I was involved in creating our pseudocode algoritm for it. 

Sunday May 15 (at home) - 45 mins 

We met as a group over zoom and discussed how to finish our game. We did a group debug/brainstorm session and I was responsible for allowing tiles to combine in 
all 4 directions. 

Tuesday May 17 (in class) - 1 hour 30 mins

As a group, we worked on making our game together. I was responsible for physically coding the ideas as we came up with ideas and committing to GitHub. I added the background grid, fixed the game over issues by making and using variables that stood for game over versus game lost, and also centered the grid. At this point, our game now has functional core game mechanics working. 

Tuesday May 18 (in class) - 45 mins 

Our goal is to now make the animation using javafx. This proved to be really tricky and I spent the whole period with my team mates brainstorming about how we could go about making it work. While we have some form of plan, we still need to work on how we will use timers (act method of the actor) and perhaps anonymous inner classes to make it work. I was responsible for pointing out that there were several places we could put the animation code, including the act method of the actor, move method of the tile, or the act method of the world, and my team mate brought up ideas how we could connect the different classes together and coded based on the ideas. 

Tuesday May 24 - 90 mins 
With my teammates, I worked on making the animation smoother by editing the GameWorld. This did not prove to be as easy as we thought it would be. We created new methods to accomplish this, such as public void setTile() and changing how we implemented combining of the tiles. We decided to change how our Tile class worked altogether, which meant refactoring much of our code. 

Friday May 27 (Brunch) - 15 mins 
I helped fix keyboard movement. There was a bug with the up arrow, where once the up arrow was pressed, the game was 'frozen' and play could not continue. 
I talked to Mr. Mcleod during brunch and learned that it was because there was a change in focus that was messing with the keyboard movement. Mr. Mcleod suggested what to do, and after trying one or two strategies and referencing stack overflow, the code worked.
